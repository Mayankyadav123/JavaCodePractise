Singleton

//one and only instance of class
//a global single point of access
/*
 * Contains
 * private constructor
 * private instance
 * public method to access
 * */
  1.  Eager initialization: instance of a class is created long before it is
   actually required
   
  2.  Lazy initialization: instance of a class is created when the client sends
   a request
   
  3.  Static block initialization: is similar to eager initialization, except 
  that the instance of the class is created in the static block that provides 
  the option for exception handling
  
  4.  Thread safe singleton: is to make the global access method is synchronized 
  so that only one thread can execute this method at a time
  
  5.  Bill Pugh singleton: implementation using the static inner helper class. 
  Static inner classes are not loaded into memory until their getInstance() 
  methods are called
  
  6.  Enum singleton: provides implicit support for thread safety and only one 
  instance is guaranteed
